# Weather App

## Overview
This is a custom weather displaying desktop application. The app fetches real-time weather data and displays it in a pixel-art style. The project is inspired by TikTok user Nashallery and her videos on cozy HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding.

## Features
- Displays weather conditions and temperature in a pixelated style.
- Dynamic background image that changes based on the time of day (day/night).
- Sprite animation that adds to the visual appeal of the app. The sprite in question is Sanrio character Pochacco. 
- Customizable app interface.
- Sprite Animations drawn by Manning Tran

## Tech Stack
- **Electron.js**: Framework for building the desktop application.
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**: Used to create the app's layout, styling, and functionality.
- **Open-Meteo API**: Provides the weather data.
- **Axios**: Used for making API requests.
- **Press Start 2P Font**: Pixel-style font for a nostalgic retro feel obtained from Google.
